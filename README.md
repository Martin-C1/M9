# M9
This repository contains the while.py file from the Module 9 Lab activity. This file contains the code for the three problems from the lab:
1. An infinite loop program that prints "infinite" and never ends.
2. A list that begins with two numbers and appends the value of a counter beginning with 0 with each iteration until the counter variable reaches 10.
3. A while loop that continuously asks the user for a number until the sum is greater than 100.
